# 🧠 Fabio's Dotfiles – Handle With Care

Welcome to my **dotfiles** — a carefully handcrafted collection of configuration chaos that somehow works.  
They're tuned for **my brain**, but if you're curious, brave, or just lost, feel free to poke around.

> ⚠️ **Warning:** May cause sudden urge to refactor your entire setup.

## 🧰 What's inside?

- `nvim/` — my Neovim config. I spent more time on this than I’d like to admit.
- `kitty/` — terminal config with enough style to make your eyes water.
- `starship.toml` — prompt config because default prompts are for mere mortals.
- `.zshrc` — where aliases go to multiply and evolve.
- `.tmux.conf` — window management for people who can’t commit to just one terminal.
- `fastfetch/` — for flexing your system stats every time you open a terminal.
- `install.sh` — plug in, power on, and watch the magic (hopefully) happen.
